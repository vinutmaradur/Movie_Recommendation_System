# Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a Movie Recommendation System. The system utilizes various machine learning techniques to recommend movies to users based on their preferences, either through collaborative filtering or content-based methods.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the ratings of other users.
- **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of the movie's attributes (genres, director, actors, etc.) to movies the user has liked.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative and content-based filtering methods to generate better recommendations.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations to analyze the movie ratings, distribution, and recommendations.

## Requirements

Before running the Movie Recommendation System, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn


You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Dataset

This system uses the [Kaggle dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_credits.csv]) which contains movie ratings and information about movies such as genre, title, and tags. Make sure to download and prepare the dataset before running the system.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd movie-recommendation-system
```

3. Run the main script to start the recommendation process:

```bash
python recommend_movies.py
```

4. The system will prompt you for user input, such as rating or movie preferences. Based on this input, the system will generate personalized movie recommendations.

## Example

After running the system, you will get movie recommendations like the following:

```bash
Recommended Movies:
1. Movie Title 1
2. Movie Title 2
3. Movie Title 3
```
